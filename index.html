I still use my spare time to educate myself in new societal vectors like machine learning, nervous system studies and coding languages. I have deep, boots on the ground, experience and have been published and won awards from some of the top media powerhouses in Los Angeles. My range of communication and team building comes from working in fields as diverse as:
